# **_Case Study - JPM Coin_**
##  **`J.P. Morgan COIN`**

A few years ago, Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s CEO famously said that any employee of his that was caught trading cryptocurrencies would be fired. And that mattered because Morgan is banking royalty. In the 19​th ​century, the House of Morgan did more than any other private institution to transform the United States from “zero to hero” economically. After merging with Chase (to become officially JP Morgan Chase), they are currently the largest bank in the United States by assets and one of the most respected, employing over 256,000 people. Nevertheless, like every other established business, they are worried about being “Amazon-ed” and rendered irrelevant by some transformative new business model. So they are trying everything they can think of to transform themselves first, including eating their words and joining the cryptocurrency bandwagon (sort of) with JPM Coin.

### **Problem Statement**:
The financial sector has always been a space where companies are driven by rigde procedures, compliance metrics and regulations. The concept of what a *bank* is, has changed significatantly over time and the constant diruptions with technology devlopments only chanlenges it more. JP Morgan, similar to many of its competitors, has been very commited to innovation within the fincial insustry. This is very evident with the banks work on its innovation division called Onyx.

JP Morgan's work to delvelop JPM Coin is a significant step in the indusrty towards evolution. This step by JP Morgan legitimizes virtual currencies in building a cryto-like payment rail. But how impactful to the industry is this project? Has JP Morgan proved its potential usfulness? These questions are explored in the case study below.

## **`So... What is it?`**
JPM Coin is a permissioned, shared ledger system that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger, enabling participating J.P. Morgan clients to transfer US Dollars held on deposit with J.P. Morgan. JPM Coin facilitates real-time value movement, helping to solve common hurdles of traditional cross-border payments.

JPM Coin runs on the Quorum Blockchain, a network internally developed to be a private version of the Ethereum network. A few months after testing, Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys acquired Quorum, bringing J.P. Morgan in as a customer of the blockchain firm.

JPM coin acts as a settlement layer between J.P. Morgan and its clients. To start the process, a client sends funds to a pre-specified account, after which the client receives the same amount in JPM coins. Once clients receive their JPM coins, they can then use these digital tokens to facilitate transactions over the Quorum blockchain. To finalize the process, a recipient of JPM coins is able to redeem them for US dollars at the nearest bank branch.

The coin is fundamentally different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Most significantly, it is redeemable at a 1:1 ratio for fiat currency held by JPMorgan. This isn’t quite a cryptocurrency, but actually a “stablecoin”, which is pegged in this case to the US Dollar. 

JPM Coin is not money in the ordinary sense. Instead, it is a digital token that represents U.S. dollars held by JPMorgan Chase. It maintains a value equal to one U.S. dollar. If JPMorgan Chase deems the launch of JPM Coin to be successful, the bank plans to use it with other fiat currencies in the future.

Fiat currencies acquire their name because they are declared to have value “by fiat” by a government; for instance a government declares that its citizens, and the government, ​must ​accept payment in that currency. So fiat currencies have value because you can pay your taxes with them.



### **Stablecoin**:
A currency is used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value, and its value has to be stable. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recently seen high levels of volatility. On an intraday basis, it is not uncommon to see cryptocurrencies jump or fall by 10 percent in a 24-hour period.

Swings of this magnitude are not characteristics of a stable currency, but they make for speculative trading instruments like derivatives which are attractive to speculators but impractical for mainstream use. This has led to serious questions about the viability of present day popular cryptocurrencies as a reliable mode of transactions.

A class of cryptocurrencies, called stablecoins, aim to offer price stability and steady valuations. A model cryptocoin should retain its purchasing power and have the minimum possible inflation, sufficient enough to encourage spending the coins instead of storing them. Stablecoins attempt to achieve this ideal behavior.

Since a cryptocurrency operates on a global level and is not controlled by any central authority (like a central bank), it offers the best of both worlds; the security, anonymity and decentralized features of a cryptocurrency, and the low volatility of a fiat currency.


### **Conclusion**:
Some believe that JPM Coin is the answer to the SWIFT payment system, featuring much faster settlement times, smaller costs as well as reduced error margins.

These questions influenced J.P. Morgan in creating a new arm of blockchain business, Onyx, that will serve as the firm’s main blockchain and digital currency efforts.

According to Takis Georgakopoulos, J.P. Morgan’s head of wholesale payments:

>*“We are launching Onyx because we believe we are shifting to a period of commercialization of those technologies, moving from research and development to something that can become a real business,”*

Although many cryptocurrency users may shun the idea of a bank-issued blockchain-based digital currency; the launch of JPM Coin leaves a significant impact on the financial industry. JP Morgan is pushing the dial on the adoption of blockchain technology.
