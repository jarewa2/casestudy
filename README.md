A few years ago, Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s CEO famously said that any employee of his that was caught trading cryptocurrencies would be fired. And that mattered because Morgan is banking royalty. In the 19​th ​century, the House of Morgan did more than any other private institution to transform the United States from “zero to hero” economically. After merging with Chase (to become officially JP Morgan Chase), they are currently the largest bank in the United States by assets and one of the most respected, employing over 256,000 people. Nevertheless, like every other established business, they are worried about being “Amazon-ed” and rendered irrelevant by some transformative new business model. So they are trying everything they can think of to transform themselves first, including eating their words and joining the cryptocurrency bandwagon (sort of) with JPM Coin.

### **Problem Statement**:
The financial sector has always been a space where companies are driven by rigde procedures, compliance metrics and regulations. The concept of what a *bank* is, has changed significatantly over time and the constant diruptions with technology devlopments only chanlenges it more. JP Morgan, similar to many of its competitors, has been very commited to innovation within the fincial insustry. This is very evident with the banks work on its innovation division called Onyx.

JP Morgan's work to delvelop JPM Coin is a significant step in the indusrty towards evolution. This step by JP Morgan legitimizes virtual currencies in building a cryto-like payment rail. But how impactful to the industry is this project? Has JP Morgan proved its potential usfulness? These questions are explored in the case study below.

## **`So... What is this?`**
JPM Coin is a permissioned, shared ledger system that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger, enabling participating J.P. Morgan clients to transfer US Dollars held on deposit with J.P. Morgan. JPM Coin facilitates real-time value movement, helping to solve common hurdles of traditional cross-border payments.

The coin is fundamentally different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Most significantly, it is redeemable at a 1:1 ratio for fiat currency held by JPMorgan. This isn’t quite a cryptocurrency, but actually a “stablecoin”, which is pegged in this case to the US Dollar. 

JPM Coin is not money in the ordinary sense. Instead, it is a digital token that represents U.S. dollars held by JPMorgan Chase. It maintains a value equal to one U.S. dollar. If JPMorgan Chase deems the launch of JPM Coin to be successful, the bank plans to use it with other fiat currencies in the future.

Fiat currencies acquire their name because they are declared to have value “by fiat” by a government; for instance a government declares that its citizens, and the government, ​must ​accept payment in that currency. So fiat currencies have value because you can pay your taxes with them.


## **Stablecoin**:
A currency is used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value, and its value has to be stable. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recently seen high levels of volatility. Between mid-November and mid-December of last year, it shot from $5,940 to above $19,190, and then it fell to levels of $6,900 by early February. Even on an intraday basis, it is not uncommon to see cryptocurrencies jump or fall by 10 percent in a 24-hour period.


Swings of this magnitude are not characteristics of a stable currency, but they make for speculative trading instruments like derivatives which are attractive to speculators but impractical for mainstream use. This has led to serious questions about the viability of present day popular cryptocurrencies as a reliable mode of transactions.
