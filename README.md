A few years ago, Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s CEO famously said that any employee of his that was caught trading cryptocurrencies would be fired. And that mattered because Morgan is banking royalty. In the 19​th ​century, the House of Morgan did more than any other private institution to transform the United States from “zero to hero” economically. After merging with Chase (to become officially JP Morgan Chase), they are currently the largest bank in the United States by assets and one of the most respected, employing over 256,000 people. Nevertheless, like every other established business, they are worried about being “Amazon-ed” and rendered irrelevant by some transformative new business model. So they are trying everything they can think of to transform themselves first, including eating their words and joining the cryptocurrency bandwagon (sort of) with JPM Coin.

### **Problem Statement**:
The financial sector has always been a space where companies are driven by rigde procedures, compliance metrics and regulations. The concept of what a *bank* is, has changed significatantly over time and the constant diruptions with technology devlopments only chanlenges it more. JP Morgan, similar to many of its competitors, has been very commited to innovation within the fincial insustry. This is very evident with the banks work on its innovation division called Onyx.

## **`So... What is this?`**
The mechanics of JPM Coin, and why it isn’t quite a cryptocurrency, but actually a “stablecoin”,which is pegged to the US Dollar. It is important to include a discussion of the differencebetween a cryptocurrency, which has no government backing, and a “fiat currency”, such as theUS Dollar 

(Fiat currencies acquire their name because they are declared to have value “by fiat”by a government, i.e. a government declares that its citizens – and the government – ​must​acceptpayment in that currency. So fiat currencies have value because you can pay your taxes withthem!).


### **What is JPM COIN**:
JPM Coin is a permissioned, shared ledger system that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger, enabling participating J.P. Morgan clients to transfer US Dollars held on deposit with J.P. Morgan. JPM Coin facilitates real-time value movement, helping to solve common hurdles of traditional cross-border payments.
